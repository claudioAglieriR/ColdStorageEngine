# ColdStorageEngine

Simple project for turning ON and OFF a cold storage’s engine, 
which must mantain the storage’s temperature between 4°C and 8°C.
The system gets the temperature from a sensor and from an external database.
All the data are uploaded on Firebase.
I made this coding project few days after I learnt how to code, 
I was just a beginner : 
this is why some coding guidelines are not respected.
