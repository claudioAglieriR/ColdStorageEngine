# ColdStorageEngine

  
 #ARDUINO PROJECT
   
Simple project for turning ON and OFF a cold storage’s engine,
which must mantain the storage’s temperature between 4°C and 8°C.  
Everything is done using a sensor, Arduino and Firebase.  
The system gets the temperature from a sensor and from an external database.  
All the data are uploaded on Firebase.  
I made this coding project few days after I learnt how to code,
I was just a beginner: 
this is why some coding guidelines are not respected.
